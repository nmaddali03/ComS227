* <h1>Backpacker.java</h1>
* <p>
* The Backpacker.java program uses a Backpacker object to model a student traveling
* around Europe with a certain amount of money and a specific location represented
* by the Location object created through the Location.java class. Here there are methods
* that calculate how many nights are affordable in lodging centers and to send postcards
* home. If the backpacker doesn't have enough money for a night, they sleep at the 
* train station. If they send postcards and call home, their parents will add money to
* their account.
